As of December 2022 (the time of writing), I'm a 4th year PhD student in [Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/).  I am advised by [Zach Branson](https://sites.google.com/site/zjbranson/?pli=1) and [Edward Kennedy](https://www.ehkennedy.com/), and also have the pleasure of working with [Siva Balakrishnan](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~siva/) and [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/).  I came to statistics via the wonderful world of economics and econometrics, so my initial interests involved and still relate to causal inference and the estimation of treatment effects.  

More recently, my focus has shifted more to the general statistical problem of functional estimation, and obtaining minimax optimal estimators.
