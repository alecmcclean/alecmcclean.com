I am a 5th-year PhD student in [Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by [Zach Branson](https://sites.google.com/site/zjbranson/?pli=1) and [Edward Kennedy](https://www.ehkennedy.com/). Additionally, I have had the pleasure of working with [Siva Balakrishnan](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~siva/) and [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/). My primary research interests are at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and causal inference. Some topics I have worked on include 

* Stochastic and dynamic interventions for observational causal inference
* Sensitivity analyses for observational causal inference
* Heterogeneous effect estimation
* Nonparametric doubly robust minimax estimation

During my PhD, I have gained experience as a teaching assistant for several courses related to causal inference and other areas of statistics. I also instructed CMU's Sophomore-level *Introduction to Statistical Inference* course.

I completed my undergraduate education at Swarthmore College, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics in 2016.  Before starting my PhD, I worked for three years as a Research Analyst and later as a Senior Research Analyst at the Brattle Group. There, I helped analyze data and build statistical models for legal, regulatory, and policy issues.
