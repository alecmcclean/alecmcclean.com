As of January 2022, I'm a 3rd year PhD student in [Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/) where I am lucky to be advised by Dr. Zach Branson and Dr. Edward Kennedy.  I came to statistics via the wonderful world of economics and econometrics, so my initial interests involved and still relate to causal inference and the estimation of treatment effects.  More recently, my focus has shifted more to the general statistical problem of functional estimation, which (at the time of writing - Jan 2022) I plan to learn more about during the latter half of my doctoral studies.
